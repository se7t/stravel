<h3>A static website created using many modern technologies, with Material UI used as a base for styling. Customized and optimized for all devices. Fully responsive and dynamic, with content served using a CMS.</h3>
<br/>

## ðŸ”¬ Technologies used

1.  **GatsbyJS**

    This project is a static site, therefore it is build with GatsbyJS.

    `https://www.gatsbyjs.com/`

1.  **Material UI**

    This library is a fundamental part of the entire project. It provides basic styling to components, which are then customized.

    `https://material-ui.com/`

1.  **Contentful CMS**

    A blog page is available, which is why I have decided to use CMS to manage posts.

    `https://www.contentful.com/`

1.  **React Hook Form**

    Contact page contains a form, and React Hook Form provides an easy to manage form hooks (duh).

    `https://react-hook-form.com/`

1.  **TheySaidSo REST API**

    TheySaidSo API provides a way to fetch a quote of a given category, which is then displayed on the Services, FAQ, and Contact page.

    `https://theysaidso.com/`

1.  **useFetch**

    This project uses both REST (for TheySaidSo API), and GraphQL (for Contentful CMS), therefore I have decided upon using the useFetch library, as it provides support for both of these.

    `https://use-http.com/`
